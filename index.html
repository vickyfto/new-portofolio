              <p>
                i'm someone without school background, before I got the chance
                to join several companies I studied front-end development
                self-taught and got guidance to become a front-end developer
                from seniors, CTO even founders. I worked for the first time at
                the age of 14-15 years old as an internet cafe operator and
                after that I've been through a lot to become like this and I am
                proud to say that people like me are very few. meet me and let's
                talk about life, believe me you will be amazed at what i've been
                through so far
