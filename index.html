              about me : i'm someone without school background, before I got the
              chance to join several companies I studied front-end development
              self-taught and got guidance to become a front-end developer from
              seniors, CTO even founders. I worked for the first time at the age
              of 14-15 years old as an internet cafe operator and after that
              I've been through a lot to become like this and I am proud to say
              that people like me are very few. meet me and let's talk about
              life, believe me you will be amazed at what i've been through so
              far
